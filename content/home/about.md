# Biography

Jude Tunyi is a post-baccalaureate IRTA research fellow at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). His research interests include studying protein-lipid interactions at membrane interfaces using computational tools like CHARMM and GROMACS. He is also interested in wet-lab experimentation especially lipid solubilization, cholesterol efflux and cell culture experiments. He is part of the Pastor Research Group in the Laboratory of Membrane Biophysics and Dr. Remaley's group in the Lipid Metabolism Section. He hopes to move onto an MD-PhD after his post-bac fellowship with a specialty in neuroscience or computational science.
